🧠 Brain Tumor Classification using MobileNetV2
📄 Overview

This project is a Deep Learning-based Brain Tumor Classification System that predicts tumor type from MRI images.
It uses MobileNetV2 (a lightweight and efficient CNN model) with fine-tuning and data augmentation to classify brain MRI scans into one of four categories:

🧬 Glioma

🧠 Meningioma

💡 No Tumor

🩸 Pituitary Tumor

The trained model is deployed using Streamlit, providing an easy-to-use web interface for medical image analysis.

🚀 Features

✅ Deep Learning model trained on real MRI images
✅ MobileNetV2 for efficient feature extraction
✅ Image augmentation to improve generalization
✅ Streamlit web interface for real-time predictions
✅ Displays class probabilities with confidence scores
✅ Model saved in .h5 format for reuse

📂 Dataset

The dataset used consists of MRI brain images collected from open medical sources and preprocessed into four folders representing the classes.
Each image was resized to 224x224 pixels and normalized before feeding into the model.

🧩 Model Architecture

Base Model: MobileNetV2 (pretrained on ImageNet)

Top Layers: GlobalAveragePooling + Dense layers + Dropout

Loss Function: Focal Loss (for class imbalance)

Optimizer: Adam

Accuracy Achieved: ~31% (baseline — can be improved with more training data & fine-tuning)

🧠 How It Works

User uploads an MRI scan image.

Image is preprocessed and passed into the MobileNetV2 model.

Model predicts the tumor type with a confidence score.

Streamlit displays the result interactively.
